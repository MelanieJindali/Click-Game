# Project: Click-Game

For this assignment, I'll create a memory game with React by breaking up the application's UI into components, managing the component state, and responding to user events.

## Overview

Click-Game is an app based on memory. A user clicks on an image for the first time, and their score increments by 1. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page and shuffled in a random order. If the user clicks on the same image more than once, their total score drops to 0.

### Technology used
